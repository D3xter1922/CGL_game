My idea is to make a first person shooter with a fluid and snappy movement systems with features such as jump and slide. I
want to impliment wallrunning too and i want to add destructable walls.
I will add multiplayer to this after im done with core mechanincs.
I aim to make most of the assets in the game by myself.

|all the assets used in the game are made by myself. i have taken no textures models or anything from outside|
DEVLOG:
	got my development environment and prefeerences set up. created a rigidbody character controller with support for sprinting on flat and inclined planes.
	added mouse movement and ground detection. added jump. wil try to add shooting with raycast and hp system tommorrow.

	added photon unity networking and UI menu to the game. implemented a menumanager script to manage opening and closing of menus.
	synced movement across deifferent instances of the game and added raycast shooting and health points system
	i have been guided by a tutorials on youtube but i have made everything on my own
	due to less time i was unable to add post processing and more maps in the game.
	i recreated the map kilhouse from COD but due to shortage of time i was not able to polish it.
	i added a crosshair and a simple ammo counter with a reload button(animation is yet to be adde here)
