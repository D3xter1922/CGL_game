# CGL Game

My idea is to make a first person shooter with a fluid and snappy movement systems with features such as jump and slide. I
want to implement wallrunning too and i want to add destructable walls.
I will add multiplayer to this after im done with core mechanincs.
I aim to make most of the assets in the game by myself

``` All the assets used in the game are made by myself. I have taken no textures models or anything from outside```   

*DEVLOG:*  
```
> Got my development environment and prefeerences set up. created a rigidbody character controller with support for sprinting on flat and inclined planes.
> Added mouse movement and ground detection. added jump. wil try to add shooting with raycast and hp system tommorrow.
> Added photon unity networking and UI menu to the game. implemented a menumanager script to manage opening and closing of menus.
> Synced movement across deifferent instances of the game and added raycast shooting and health points system
> I have been guided by a tutorials on youtube but I have made everything on my own
> Due to less time i was unable to add post processing and more maps in the game.
> I recreated the map kilhouse from COD but due to shortage of time i was not able to polish it.
> I added a crosshair and a simple ammo counter with a reload button(animation is yet to be adde here)	
> I plan to contue developing the game even after the selection round of CGL
> I have made 20 c# scripts
```
